This will contain my analysis projects 
This is one of mt first personal project that i have taken up to learn data visualization, i collected my personal spotify data and analyzed it. 
The data is sent by spotify as a JSON file, i performed ETL(Extract Transform Load) on the data buy converting the JSON file to an XLSX file with the use of excel power query  
I started by converting some data provided to a different value, i converted the millisecond of play to minutes of play with the formula ((millisecond of songs/1000)/60)
I then loaded this XLXS file into tableau for further analysis, i cleaned up the names of columns and then started my analysis 
I created a bar chart to view the artist that i've listened to with a filter of over 100 minutes of playtime
The chart showed me that BIBI was one of my most listened to artist 
After i completed the analysis, i exported my cleaned up dataset as a csv file that can be further used by other people.
